# U2 (prior) — owned hulls: triangles of owned points, promotion of several targets at once

`U2Rules` forbids single owned points.  Here the owned set of a square is used through its convex
hull (the open square is convex):

* `owned_of_tri` — a grid point certified in the hull of three owned points (`triGroupOk`) is owned.
* A *triangle option* `[g]` forbids every pose capturing some point of the group `g`, when `g` lies
  in the hull of three points owned by another square.
* `owned_all_of_tris` (**promotion**): a cover whose leaves are walls, cells, triangle options, or the
  target option `targets.map (fun p => [p])` (all targets at once) proves every target owned.
* `excluded_of_tris` (**terminal**): a cover by triangle options alone excludes the case.

A triangle is `(o', a, b, c, g, ls)`: owner `o'`, vertices `a b c`, lattice points `g` with their
barycentric weights `ls` over the common denominator `bm`.
