# Splitting the rest of the n = 11 formalization

Branch `work/split` of `publish-n11-lean` (local; not pushed). Each unit is one Lean file in
`lean/Sqpack/S11Opt/Split/`. **One owner per file; nobody edits another unit's file.** Shared
definitions live in `Interface.lean`, which 9c owns. Ask 9c to add a definition there.

`U6Final.lean` composes the units into `minSide 11 = T`, and that composition compiles now. Its
only `sorry`s are the units' own theorems and `frame`:
`#print axioms minSide_eq_T` shows `sorryAx`, and it will show only the standard three once
every unit is proved.

The units that are independent **now** are U1, U2Rules (then U2Generic, U2Prior and
U2Returned, each independently), U4 and UField. Two units take other results as hypotheses:
U3 takes `NoncandidateExcluded`, and U5 uses U4. Each can therefore be proved before the result
it depends on is finished.

## Units

Section numbers (§) refer to the author's PROOF.md. File paths are relative to
`src/evidence/` of Queuingtheorydotcom/11SquaresOptimal f9e0de7. The large inputs are Git LFS
objects: read them by content hash from `data/INDEX.json`, as 9c's `scripts/s11opt/author.py`
does. A read-only clone with all objects is in 69's scratchpad (`sq11opt/`, 4.5 GB).

## Conventions

- Lean 4.33.1, Mathlib v4.33.1, evand/square-packing `6e1223c` (see `build.sh` on `main`). Base
  your workspace on `formal/n11-optimal-lean` or on a `build.sh` checkout.
- No `native_decide`, no new `axiom`. Kernel data checks use `decide +kernel`. Large trees are
  split into files of at most 50k leaves (as in `S11Opt/F*/Cov*P*.lean`).
- Heavy kernel checks go to GCP, arranged with 5d. The mother machine is for re-verification only.
- Record progress in `docs/flow/` and tell 9c and 5d at milestones.
